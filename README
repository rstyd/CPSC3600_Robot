Robot ID: 2agreeable Image_Id: 5


Description:
	The purpose of this program is to create a HTTP/UDP client server program to interact with a given robot. In addition to its interaction with the robot it should be able to communicate with other server clients programs of other groups in the class. 



KNOWN PROBLEMS:
One particular problem that our program faces is that we can download images, but they end up getting corrupted. 
It seems like the TCP server is not sending the correct amount of data. 



DESIGN:
We based our program off of the design featured in the Supplementary Specification and FInal Project Specification on Piazza. Unfrotunately, these two documents often conflict each other. We decided to pick a mixture of the two that would work for our needs. 

To run the program, use these commmand line arguments.

client:
./robotClient <address of RobotClient> <port> <robotID> <L> 4

server:
./robotServer <port> <ipAddress of robotServer> <robotID> <ID>
