Robot ID: 2agreeable 
Image_Id: 5


Description:
	The purpose of this program is to create a HTTP/UDP client server program to interact with a given robot. 
	In addition to its interaction with the robot it should be able to communicate with other 
		server clients programs of other groups in the class. 



KNOWN PROBLEMS:
The host is set as castara.cs.clemson.edu; any attempt to resolve
the ip address of castara gives some server in France.



DESIGN:
We based our program off of the design featured in the Supplementary Specification and Final Project Specification on Piazza. Unfrotunately, these two documents often conflict each other. We decided to pick a mixture of the two that would work for our needs. 

To run the program, use these commmand line arguments.

client:
./robotClient <address of RobotClient> <port> <robotID> <L> 4

server:
./robotServer <port> <ipAddress of robotServer> <robotID> <ID>
